SVM is one type of classification and regression algorithm  which is maily focused on the maximal margin hyperplane. Figure below shows two different classes seperating by three hyperplanes and also we can plot infinity hyperplanes to classify those two classes.

Although their training errors are zero there is no guarantee that the hyperplanes will perform equally well on unseen data.The classifier must choose one of these hyperplanes to represent its decision boundary, based on how well they are expected to perform on test samples.
Decision boundaries with large margins tend to have better generalization
errors than those with small margins.Intuitively, if the margin is small, then any slight perturbations to the decision boundary can have quite a significant impact on its classification Classifiers that produce decision boundaries with small margins are therefore more susceptible to model overfitting and tend to generalize poorly on previously unseen data, so SVM tries to locate the hyperplane such that distance is maximum from both the classes.  
##### How SVM is selecting margin: 
Consider a binary classification problem as shown in below figure and the hyperplane is \\(\pi\\). and two planes whcich are parallel to the hyperplane and passing through nearest point of each class are  \\(\pi_+\\) and  \\(\pi_-\\).
