In this i am discussing about creating word vectors using SVD and co-occurrence matrix. For doing this used data base of amazon 
fine food reviews data set, downloded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews/data). Cleaned the data
and after that took top 5000 top tfidf words because of time taken to calculate co-occurrence matrix is high. Created co-occurrence matrix
as below
~~~ python
def cooccurrence_matrix(list_words,distance,sentances):
  '''
  Returns co-occurrence matrix of words with in a distance of occurrrence
  input:
  list_words: list of words to get the co-occurrance matrix in order
  distance: distance between words
  sentances: documets to check ( a list )
  output:
  co-occurance matrix in te order of list_words order
  '''
  #length of matrix needed
  l = len(list_words)
  #creating a zero matrix
  com = np.zeros((l,l))
  #creating word and index dict
  dict_idx = {v:i for i,v in enumerate(list_words)}
  for sentence in sentances:
    sentence=sentence.strip()
    tokens= sentence.split()
    for pos,token in enumerate(tokens):
      #if eord is in required words
      if token in list_words:
        #start index to check any other word occure or not
        start=max(0,pos-distance)
        #end index
        end=min(len(tokens),pos+distance+1)
        for pos2 in range(start,end):
          #if same position
          if pos2==pos:
            continue
          # if same word
          if token == tokens[pos2]:
            continue
          #if word found is in required words
          if tokens[pos2] in list_words:
            #index of word parent
            row = dict_idx[token]
            #index of occurance word
            col = dict_idx[tokens[pos2]]
            #adding value to that index
            com[row,col] = com[row,col] + 1
return com
