Optimization is a methodology for finding the maximum or minimum value a real function.More generally,optimization includes finding 
"best available" values of some objective function given a defined domain (or input), including a variety of different types of objective 
functions and different types of domains.  
#### Unconstrained Optimization:  
Suppose f(x) is a univariate function with continuous first-order and secondorder derivatives. In an unconstrained optimization problem, the task is to locate the solution x* that maximizes or minimizes f(x) without imposing anycconstraints on x*. The solution x*, which is known as a stationary point, can be found by taking the first derivative of f(x) and setting it to zero:
